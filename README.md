### **_Description_**

#### My project, Whak!, is a game based off the the classic 1972 game, Whack-a-mole. This game was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will be the first time displaying my engineering skills I have aquired in just two weeks.

### **_Getting Started_**

#### In this single player game, the object is to whack each mole as fast as you can before time runs out. Use your mallet to whack these pesky moles, and get them back in their holes. Each mole you hit, you get a point. There are nine moles, so be quick!
